## Component Set

A Component Set is basically a container that holds multiple versions of the same component. These versions are called **variants**.  
All variants share the same base structure, but they differ by certain properties—like size, color, state, or layout.

Think of it like buttons:
- Default button  
- Hover button  
- Pressed button  
- Disabled button  

All of them are still “one button,” but with different states. A Component Set groups these together so they’re easier to organize and update.

Why it’s useful:
- Keeps your design system consistent  
- Makes switching between variations faster  
- Helps you maintain clean, scalable UI  
- Reduces repetitive work because updates apply across all variants

In short: **Component Sets let you manage many versions of one component in a structured and efficient way.**
