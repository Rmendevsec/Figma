## Typography 
- The art and science of arranging text to be both legible and appeling
- Style or appearance of text
- The art of working with text
- It is powerful. It can change how we feel about a message being conveyed
## Common Types of Fonts

- **Serif**: have little stroke called serifs attached to the main part of the letter
    - It is good for traditional projects. They're also common in print publications like magazines and newspapers
- **San Serif**: don't have that extra stroke - hence the name, which is French for "without serif". This considerd ad more clean and modern than serif. Also easy to read in all devices

- **Display Fonts**:mcome in many different styles like script, blackletter, all-caps and just plain fancy. The're best for small amount of text. for example titles and headers and more graphic-heavy designs.

## Hirarchy
- used to guide the reader's eye to whatever is most important 
- Changing the size of our text is also a simle way to create hirarchy
## Leading 
- The space between lines of text (also known as line spacing)
- Leading or line spacing is the vertical space between lines.
- The common recomendation is to make our leading 120% - 150% larger than the point size of our text.
## Tracking
- It is overall  space between characters, sometimes called character spacing
- It is adjesting the overall spacing of our letters, making the text look loose, tight, or just right

## Kerning
- Is the space between specific characters
- It refers to the amount of space between two letters and the process of adjusting that space
- An average length of 45 to 75 characters per line including apaces and punctuation is a common rule of thumb. 

## Fonts VS Typefaces
- A font is the thing we use like a specific style weight, or width within the typeface family.
- A typeface is created by a designer and consists of a particular set of letters, numerals and punctuation.

- **Helvertica is typeface Helvertica Bold is font**
- Using fonts with different weights or widths is a greate way to create impact and hirarchy in our design

## Spacing and Alignment
- Alignment is the arrangement or adjestment of objects to make them sit together.
- It also applies to how the lines of text are arranged. Usually left, centered, or right

## Pairing fonts
- There's a science to styling headings, subheadings, and body copy to suit the type of content you're producing and the message or tone of our design.
- A single font with a few style variants is a clever way to create nuance without over complicating things.
- Here, the Serif is used in a bold, all caps, and regular version.
- The combination has a strong hirarchy while looking stylish, organized, and refined.
- We can also combine fonts from the same category. 
- Pairing completely different typeface is a great way to add character and movement to our design.

1. Basic Terms
- **Baseline**: Invisible line where text sits.
- **X-height**: Parts of lowercase "x"; defines text proportion.
- **Ascenders**: Parts of letters rising above x-height (e.g b,d,h)
- **Descenders**: Parts going below baseline (e.g. g, p, h)
- **Weight**: Thickness of strokes
- **Letter spacing(Tracking)**: Space between all letters.
- **Line height(Leading)**: Space between lines of text.
- **Line length**: 40-60 characters per line

2. Type Anatomy
- **Serif:** Fonts with small strokes at letter ends(e.g. Times New Roman).
- **San Serif:** Fonts without serifs (e.g Inter, Open Sans)

3. Letter Case
- **UPPER CASE**: All caps
- **lower case**: No capitals
- **Sentence case**: First word capitalized 
- **Title Case**: Each main word capitalized

4. Typeface Category
- **Serif** - Traditional, readable in print
- **San Serif** - Modern, clean for screens
- **Script/Handwriting** - Natural, decorative
- **Display** - For large titles, not for body text

5. Font Pairing Tips
- Create contrast (different sizes/weights)
- Justify left for better readability 
- Use one versatile font family with multiple weights
Pair fonts by contrast (e.g. Serif + Sans Serif) or similarity
- Check font pairing on Google Fonts or typewolf.com

6. Good UI Fonts
- Inter . Space Grotesk . Work Sans . DM Sans . Satoshi . Lexend . Source Sans . Switzer . Open Sans
