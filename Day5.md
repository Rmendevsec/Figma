# Auto Layout

## What is Auto Layout?
Auto Layout is a property applied to frames and components that allows designs to automatically grow, shrink, or reflow as their content changes. It maintains alignment, keeps consistent spacing, and makes responsive design easier.

## How to Add Auto Layout
- Click the Auto Layout icon in the design panel.
- Shortcut: **Shift + A** to add Auto Layout.
- Shortcut: **Shift + Ctrl + A** (Ctrl + Alt + Shift + A) for Auto Layout suggestions.
- Right–click on a frame and choose "Add Auto Layout".

## Resizing
- **Fixed:** The size stays constant; works on parent or child.
- **Hug:** The frame adjusts to fit its content; used on parents.
- **Fill:** The content expands to fill the available space; used on children.
- Min/Max values can be added for more control over width and height.

## Padding
Padding controls the space inside a frame between its content and edges. You can set uniform padding or define individual top, right, bottom, and left values to manage spacing more precisely.
