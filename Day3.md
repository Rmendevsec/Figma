# Color Mastery
- when we use colors intentionally, it shapes emotion, attention and usability. when used randomly, it destroys clarity even if everything is good

## The Purpose of color in Design
- color has four jobs in UI/UX:
 1. **Communicate emotion** (safe, exciting, premium, fun)
 2. **Guide attention** (what users should notice first)
 3. **Strength brand identity** (what makes the product recognizable)
 4. **Support usability** (readability, structure, interaction)

 If our color choices don't support these four, the palett is weak

 ## Color Psychology (The Emotion Layer)
 - Every color carries emotional weight. Not universally perfect, but generally consistent.

 - **Blue**: trust, intelligence, calm
 - **Red**: urgency, danger, passion
 - **Green**: growth, natural, safe
 - **Yellow**: hapiness, creativity
 - **Purple**: luxury, sprituality, imagination
 - **Orange**: energy, friendliness
 - **Black**: authority, clarity, elegance
 - **White**: purity, simplicity
 - **Gray**: neutrality, structure

 ## Dominant & Accent Colours
 - We should choose 5 colors for our brand's color pallet. Include two dominant colours and three accent colours
 - Dominant colors are our main colors.
- Accent colours have two important roles to play. One accent color of the three should be used as a highlighter. The other two colours should be more natural and subtle, allowing us two dominant colours and our one accent colour acting as a highliter to do most of the work.
