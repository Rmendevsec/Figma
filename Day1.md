# Principles of Layout

 ## Focal Point
 - The center of interest
 - The location to which our eye is drawn - where things meet or diverge
 
 ## White Space
 - Just as music needs dynamics (loud and quite), layouts need white space.
 - "White space" means quite areas of visual rest which give our other elements room to breath

 ## Hirarchy
 - Give priority to the most important elements.
 - This helps orient our reader and lead them along the journy
 - Headlines tend to be more prominent than body copy. Imagercy can either take centre-stage or blend into the background depending on our intention

 ## Grouping 
- Instead of spacing elements out evenly, gather things that belong together
- This helps the reader make sense of the information

## Scale
- Employ large contrasts in size to add drama.
- Try huge headlines, small captions, or full bleed image next to layouts with lost of white space

## Sequence
- We should think about a user scrolling down a page. Panels shouldn't be considered in isolation but as part of a sequence which creates a cinematic experience
- Flicking through  a well-designed coffee table book produces a  similar effect as the layout "moves around" whilst leafing through

## Alignment
- Be delibrate with vertical axes
- Be attentive to horizontal baselines too
- Responsive layouts on the web represent a challenge, and each screen size should be created for and checked carefully, seemingly random alignment looks amateurish

## Balance
- Symmetry is often employed because it is the easiest way of achieving balance.
- Center alignment is suitable for certain formats and can work for very short sections of text
- However, text flush-left should be the default. It is much easier to read and preferable graphically as the rag is only one side.
- Asymmetrical layouts are more flexible and often look more elegant. Simply use counterbalancing elements to distribute the visual "Weight".

## Grids 
- Command of the grid allows us to achieve all of the above 
- It is the most useful tool for the designer wishing to produce an effective layout. The structure produces order and conveys confidence   

## Types of website
- There is 5 types of website
1. E-commerce
2. Marketing/Business
3. Content
4. Educational
5. Portfolio


## Sitemap  
A sitemap outlines the overall structure of the website. It shows how pages connect, helps organize content, and ensures a smooth user flow. It’s useful for planning navigation and making sure every page has a clear purpose.

## Wireframes  
Wireframes are simple visual layouts that show the structure of each page without focusing on colors or design details. They help define placement of elements, user flow, and content hierarchy before moving to high-fidelity designs.
